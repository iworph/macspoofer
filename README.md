# macspoofer

this macspoofer is my first proper linux bash project

## requrements

```superuser permissions and net-tools```

## setup

```chmod +rwx $route/to/macspoof.sh``
$route/to/macspoof.sh```

### details

on first run the macspoofer will create an alias "macspoof" and then will run the rest of the spoofing, aditionally i found the first mac address needs to be even so its two vars (technically 3) combined, first var is the first digit, and the second var is a second digit * 2
sorry if this isnt that good i just threw it together
